Exercises for section 7

--Use UNION to solve these tasks. 
--Note that these tasks could possibly be solved by another non-UNION statement.
--Can you also write a non-UNION statement that produces the same result?   

e7.1	In one result, list all the people who enrolled in a paper delivered during 2019 and
	all the people who have enrolled in IN605. 
	The result should have three columns: PersonID, Full Name and the reason the person
	is on the list - either 'enrolled in 2019' or 'enrolled in IN605'

e7.2	Produce one resultset with two columns. List the all Paper Names and all the Person Full Names in one column.
	In the other column calculate the number of characters in the name.
	Sort the result with the longest name first.
